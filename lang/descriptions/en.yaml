    # Adrien Pavie
    3: >
      Adrien hosts a tool which conflate some OSM objects (coming from Overpass or directly Osmose) to nearests Mapillary pictures. Pic4Review allows contributors to fix errors or add missing information with user friendly interface and relevent options. Users may setup their own quests with custom Overpass queries and options. Mappers then use the quest and review items as often as mapillary got completed around selected osm features. This is a great add to available tools and improve data on even complex situations with clear directions on how to do so.
    # Grigory Rechistov
    62: >
      For a truly stunning preparation for the landcover import in Sweden. Grigory has started several discussions on the mailing list, developed a complex tool for conflating geometry and writes long and clear blog articles about the process that would surely help future landcover imports go smoothly.

    # Brian Prangle
    34: >
      Continued work in the nitty-gritty of communities. Brian helped setup the West Midlands OSM group in then UK. Brian helped set up the OSM UK local chapter, and served as chair of the board for the first 3 years. When nobody else is replying to organisations and representing the OpenStreetMap community, Brian often steps up to the plate. Brian uses his time to get in touch with a lot of big organisations and local authorities, so that they know about OpenStreetMap and so that the local chapter has some money to work with and pay it's small bills with. Yet in all of this, you still see Brian's love for the mapping when he sits talking to a couple of people and showing them how to map, encouraging them to use tools like the map editors and street-level cameras, regardless of their age or technical confidence.
    # Brian Hollinshead
    27: >
      Brian Hollinshead has been a tireless OSM mapper for years. He's helped extensivly with heritage mapping in Ireland, and with the multi-year townland project. He has often gone to historical societies and events to speak about, and promote, OSM to people who've never heard of it before. ( e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pxfnD4aQTg ). This can help bring new mappers into OSM.
    # Nathalie Sidibe

      Nathalie has been a fantastic advocate of the entire OSM project but particularly the local community in Mali.
    # Severin Menard

      Ed writes about how OpenStreetMap is becoming the world's mapping standard and chainging the way we collect and consume map data.
    # Christopher Beddow and Daniela Waltersdorfer
    10: >
      Chris (cbeddow) and Dani (dani) summarized the current state of curbs on OpenStreetMap and made a call for the community to further embrace curbs as an important piece of data for mobility, infrastructure, and transportation. 
    # Valeriy Trubin
    63: >
      He started translating WeeklyOSM into Russian this April, but did not stop at that. He also has been taking interviews with many OSM members, more or less prominent, transcribing and editing them for the most popular Russian tech website. He is very active in the community, and thanks to him, the Russian community does not feel stagnant.
    # Steve Friedl, Guillaume Rischard

      For the very extensive and in-depth report about unusual signups to OSMF before the elections; and for constant active work in the Membership Working Group.
  team:
    # Kaart

      For traveling across the world, gathering ground truth data and improving map data based on that. Fast growing team of now over 150 mapping enthusiasts.
    # OSM DRC/RDC
    11: >
      The Democratic Republic of the Congo/République Démocratique du Congo OpenStreetMap community has done remarkable work in coordinating the multiple humanitarian mapping responses in their country, outreach to both official stakeholders and potential contributors, and are playing an important role in the overall geographic information infrastructure of their country. While they are still growing and developing new activities, they already provide a great example of a local community who managed to become a leader in their country both towards local and international actors, and to me are a model for the empowerment of local communities in the "global South".
    # Data Working Group

      For their help against the vandalism and constant daily work on keeping the map clean.
    # Kontur Inc

      Miriam's work to help lower the barrier for entry to the world of OSM and to make the community more accessible and diverse is appreciated not just in her home country of Mexico, but all across the Americas. She has worked hard to grow mapping access across Latin America through her work with Telenav and by sharing her trainings and teaching lessons learned to others in the community.
    # Minh Nguyen
    61: >
      Minh always goes out of his way to help other mappers. If he doesn't know the answer to a question you can be sure he will after some short research - and a detailed explanation to boot.  Minh embodies the collaborative spirit of the OSM project and we are lucky to have him.
    # Victor Scherb
    71: >
      For creating OsmAnd application and supporting it over the years, keeping it the only major OSM-based app with no corporate influence, and constantly imagining ways to expand user-facing side of open data.
